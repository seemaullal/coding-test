# ** Article Information and Analytics ** #
### View different posts loaded from an external API and also view analytics regarding each post which contains tracker data. ###


##  About
 - On the home page, there is a list of posts. Click on one for more information
 - The post details page has two parts. In the first tab, you can see basic post information such as its title and article contents. The second contains tracker information loaded from an external API. Since the original tracker information contained a bug, it has been fixed so that data is in the correct format. You can select two dates and view the tracker information between those dates.
